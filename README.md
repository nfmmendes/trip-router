# Trip Router

This repository, as the name suggests, stores trip routing solver created as an Operations Research exercise/showcase and also as a tutorial/logbook. 
The main objective of creating this solver is not to investigate new algorithms to solve the problem, neither deliver a consumer/business software, but providing a "how to do" code to those interested in optimization problems but not so much in the terms or complex algorithms/math commonly present on books or articles about the subject.
